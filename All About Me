    <h1>All About Sam Ford</h1>

  <body>
    <p>Hello I'm Sam Ford and this is my "All About Me" page. Where shall I begin? I'm 19 years old and live in New York City to attend Lang College of Liberal Arts at The New School. This is my second year and I'm majoring in Journalism and Design with a minor in Environmental Studies. With my two degrees combined, I hope to be a climate reporter, as climate change and the environment weigh on my mind a little too frequently. This semester, I joined the New School Free Press and it's been intensive yet exciting. I also recently joined The New School's HerCampus chapter, an online blog written by college women for college women. I basically get to write what I want for them, so being able to explore the things I find joy in wiritng about has taught me a lot. To conclude, I have found coding to be quite fun so far, it makes me feel smart.</p>
